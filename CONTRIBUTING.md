## Code of Conduct
Everyone who participates in this project is governed by the PyCQA [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct).

## Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug, please let us know about it. See the guide here [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

**Before submitting a new issue** you might want to check for an [existing issue](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/issues) to know if there is already a reported issue. If an issue is already open please feel free
to add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

### Submitting your first issue
We encourage using the issue template to improve quality of reported issues.
Navigate to the issues tab and select `New issue`, then select the **Bug report** template and fill out the form.
To submit a good bug report keep in mind to:
* Use a descriptive title so other people can understand what the issue is about.
* Be specific about the details, for example, what command did you use, what version of Bandit did you use, and in what environment you observed the bug (CI or development).

## Suggesting Enhancements
If you want to suggest an enhancement, open a new issue and use the **Feature request** template.

**Before submitting an enhancement** please check for existing [feature requests](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).

Useful things to point out in your feature request:
* Explain your feature request in a way that everyone can understand
* Please try to explain how this feature will improve the Bandit project

## Your First Code Contribution
You can start contributing to Bandit project by picking [bug issues](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug)
These issues can be easier to resolve rather than a feature request and can get you up and running with the code base.

## Pull Requests
The best way to get started with Bandit is to grab the source:

Fork the repository into one with your username
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/bandit.git
```

Create you own branch to start writing code:
```shell script
git checkout -b mybranch
git push origin mybranch
```
You can test any changes with tox:

```shell script
pip install tox
tox -e pep8
tox -e py37
tox -e docs
tox -e cover
```
If everything is done, proceed with [opening a new pull request](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request)

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the commit formatting recommendations found on [Chris Beams' How to Write a Git Commit Message article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Well formed commit messages not only help reviewers understand the nature of
the Pull Request, but also assists the release process where commit messages
are used to generate release notes.

A good example of a commit message would be as follows:

```
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789
```

Note the `Resolves #123` tag, this references the issue raised and allows us to
ensure issues are associated and closed when a pull request is merged.

Please refer to [the github help page on message types](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)
for a complete list of issue references.

### Squash Commits

Should your pull request consist of more than one commit (perhaps due to
a change being requested during the review cycle), please perform a git squash
once a reviewer has approved your pull request.

A squash can be performed as follows. Let's say you have the following commits:

    initial commit
    second commit
    final commit

Run the command below with the number set to the total commits you wish to
squash (in our case 3 commits):

    git rebase -i HEAD~3

You default text editor will then open up and you will see the following::

    pick eb36612 initial commit
    pick 9ac8968 second commit
    pick a760569 final commit

    # Rebase eb1429f..a760569 onto eb1429f (3 commands)

We want to rebase on top of our first commit, so we change the other two commits
to `squash`:

    pick eb36612 initial commit
    squash 9ac8968 second commit
    squash a760569 final commit

After this, should you wish to update your commit message to better summarise
all of your pull request, run:

    git commit --amend

You will then need to force push (assuming your initial commit(s) were posted
to github):

    git push origin your-branch --force

## Things You Should Know Before Getting Started

### Vulnerability Tests
Vulnerability tests or "plugins" are defined in files in the plugins directory.

Tests are written in Python and are autodiscovered from the plugins directory.
Each test can examine one or more type of Python statements. Tests are marked
with the types of Python statements they examine (for example: function call,
string, import, etc).

Tests are executed by the ``BanditNodeVisitor`` object as it visits each node
in the AST.

Test results are managed in the ``Manager`` and aggregated for
output at the completion of a test run through the method `output_result` from ``Manager`` instance.

### Writing Tests
To write a test:
 - Identify a vulnerability to build a test for, and create a new file in
   examples/ that contains one or more cases of that vulnerability.
 - Consider the vulnerability you're testing for, mark the function with one
   or more of the appropriate decorators:
   - @checks('Call')
   - @checks('Import', 'ImportFrom')
   - @checks('Str')
 - Create a new Python source file to contain your test, you can reference
   existing tests for examples.
 - The function that you create should take a parameter "context" which is
   an instance of the context class you can query for information about the
   current element being examined.  You can also get the raw AST node for
   more advanced use cases.  Please see the context.py file for more.
 - Extend your Bandit configuration file as needed to support your new test.
 - Execute Bandit against the test file you defined in examples/ and ensure
   that it detects the vulnerability.  Consider variations on how this
   vulnerability might present itself and extend the example file and the test
   function accordingly.


### Extending Bandit

Bandit allows users to write and register extensions for checks and formatters.
Bandit will load plugins from two entry-points:

- `bandit.formatters`
- `bandit.plugins`

Formatters need to accept 5 things:

- `manager`: an instance of `bandit manager`
- `fileobj`: the output file object, which may be sys.stdout
- `sev_level` : Filtering severity level
- `conf_level`: Filtering confidence level
- `lines=-1`: number of lines to report

Plugins tend to take advantage of the `bandit.checks` decorator which allows
the author to register a check for a particular type of AST node. For example

::

    @bandit.checks('Call')
    def prohibit_unsafe_deserialization(context):
        if 'unsafe_load' in context.call_function_name_qual:
            return bandit.Issue(
                severity=bandit.HIGH,
                confidence=bandit.HIGH,
                text="Unsafe deserialization detected."
            )

To register your plugin, you have two options:

1. If you're using setuptools directly, add something like the following to
   your ``setup`` call::

        # If you have an imaginary bson formatter in the bandit_bson module
        # and a function called `formatter`.
        entry_points={'bandit.formatters': ['bson = bandit_bson:formatter']}
        # Or a check for using mako templates in bandit_mako that
        entry_points={'bandit.plugins': ['mako = bandit_mako']}

2. If you're using pbr, add something like the following to your `setup.cfg`
   file::

        [entry_points]
        bandit.formatters =
            bson = bandit_bson:formatter
        bandit.plugins =
            mako = bandit_mako
