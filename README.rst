Overview
--------

Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. To do
this Bandit processes each file, builds an AST from it, and runs appropriate
plugins against the AST nodes. Once Bandit has finished scanning all the files
it generates a report.

Bandit was originally developed within the OpenStack Security Project and
later rehomed to PyCQA.

Container Images
----------------

Bandit is available as a container image, built within the bandit repository
using GitHub Actions. The image is available on ghcr.io:

.. code-block:: console

    docker pull ghcr.io/pycqa/bandit/bandit

The image is built for the following architectures:

* amd64
* arm64
* armv7
* armv8

To pull a specific architecture, use the following format:

.. code-block:: console

    docker pull --platform=<architecture> ghcr.io/pycqa/bandit/bandit:latest

Every image is signed with sigstore cosign and it is possible to verify the
source of origin using the following cosign command:

.. code-block:: console

    cosign verify ghcr.io/pycqa/bandit/bandit:latest \
      --certificate-identity https://github.com/pycqa/bandit/.github/workflows/build-publish-image.yml@refs/tags/<version> \
      --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com

Where `<version>` is the release version of Bandit.
