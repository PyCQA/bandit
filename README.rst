Overview
--------

Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. To do
this Bandit processes each file, builds an AST from it, and runs appropriate
plugins against the AST nodes. Once Bandit has finished scanning all the files
it generates a report.

Bandit was originally developed within the OpenStack Security Project and
later rehomed to PyCQA.
