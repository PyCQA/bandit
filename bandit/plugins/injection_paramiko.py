B601: Test for shell injection within Paramiko
==============================================

Paramiko is a Python library designed to work with the SSH2 protocol for secure
(encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. It is intended to
run commands on a remote host. These commands are run within a shell on the
target and are thus vulnerable to various shell injection attacks. Bandit
reports a MEDIUM issue when it detects the use of Paramiko's "exec_command"
method advising the user to check inputs are correctly sanitized.

:Example:

.. code-block:: none

    >> Issue: Possible shell injection via Paramiko call, check inputs are
       properly sanitized.
       Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
       Location: ./examples/paramiko_injection.py:4
    3    # this is not safe
    4    paramiko.exec_command('something; really; unsafe')
    5

.. seealso::

.. versionadded:: 0.12.0
