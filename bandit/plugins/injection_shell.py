    Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable. However,
    doing so may present a security issue if appropriate care is not taken to
    sanitize any user provided or variable input.

    This plugin test is part of a family of tests built to check for process
    spawning and warn appropriately. Specifically, this test looks for the
    spawning of a subprocess using a command shell. This type of subprocess
    invocation is dangerous as it is vulnerable to various shell injection
    attacks. Great care should be taken to sanitize all input in order to
    mitigate this risk. Calls of this type are identified by a parameter of
    'shell=True' being given.

    Additionally, this plugin scans the command string given and adjusts its
    reported severity based on how it is presented. If the command string is a
    simple static string containing no special shell characters, then the
    resulting issue has low severity. If the string is static, but contains
    shell formatting characters or wildcards, then the reported issue is
    medium. Finally, if the string is computed using Python's string
    manipulation or formatting operations, then the reported issue has high
    severity. These severity levels reflect the likelihood that the code is
    vulnerable to injection.

    namely `shell_injection`. This configuration is divided up into three
    sections, `subprocess`, `shell` and `no_shell`. They each list Python calls
    that spawn subprocesses, invoke commands within a shell, or invoke commands
    without a shell (by replacing the calling process) respectively.

    """**B607: Test for starting a process with a partial path**

    Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable. If the
    desired executable path is not fully qualified relative to the filesystem
    root then this may present a potential security risk.

    In POSIX environments, the `PATH` environment variable is used to specify a
    set of standard locations that will be searched for the first matching
    named executable. While convenient, this behavior may allow a malicious
    actor to exert control over a system. If they are able to adjust the
    contents of the `PATH` variable, or manipulate the file system, then a
    bogus executable may be discovered in place of the desired one. This
    executable will be invoked with the user privileges of the Python process
    that spawned it, potentially a highly privileged user.

    This test will scan the parameters of all configured Python methods,
    looking for paths that do not start at the filesystem root, that is, do not
    have a leading '/' character.

    **Config Options:**

    This plugin test shares a configuration with others in the same family,
    namely `shell_injection`. This configuration is divided up into three
    sections, `subprocess`, `shell` and `no_shell`. They each list Python calls
    that spawn subprocesses, invoke commands within a shell, or invoke commands
    without a shell (by replacing the calling process) respectively.

    This test will scan parameters of all methods in all sections. Note that
    methods are fully qualified and de-aliased prior to checking.
